Open your project settings and go to linker. 

- Add additional dependency : libmysql.lib 

Make sure you have the include files, libraries, and binary files. 
If you don't have it then just download MySQL Server without the installer, then point the include paths for your project to the lib directories for mysql that you downloaded.
